### Exploring, Collecting, and Sharing Data on Deaths in U.S. Prisons

In this project, we created a dashboard on data availability of deaths in U.S. prisons. This repository is largely data wrangling and exploration to enable behind-the-scenes extrapolation and dataset improvement. It includes visualizations for the complete dashboard as well as datasets created for statistical conclusivity.

This project also sought to automate dataset creation using Amazon mTurk. Exploratory and investigative files for that process are contained in this repository.

# Repository Guide

All working documents are stored in the `working_doc_files` folder, which is separated into:

-   `cod_working_docs`: Documents wrangling cause of death data for visualization

-   `facility_list_analysis`: Documents used for facility list cross referencing in May 2024

-   `mturk_files:` HTML files and analysis files for mTurk preliminary results

-   Miscellaneous files

All generated and used data files are in the `data` folder. A few webscraping drafts (may be used later) are in the `webscraping` folder.
