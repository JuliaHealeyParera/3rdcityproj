"784","Roscoe Police Department","01/13/2023","04:30 a.m.",19,"Male","White","Hispanic or Latino","On 03/16/24, I, [redacted], was at the Roscoe Police Department when I heard officers from South Beloit PD frantically call 10-78 and shots fired over the radio meaning, they were shot at or shot at a suspect based on a threat of great bodily harm. South Beloit Officers advised the suspect fled on foot east bound from the location (Hwy 251 and Prairie Hill Rd). To the east of this location is the Macktown Lounge bar and a quarry that is surrounded by fencing with barbed wire. The Roscoe Police Department provides mutual aid with Rockton, South Beloit, and Winnebago County to aid and assist as there is limited manpower over the large geographic area these departments cover in Northern Winnebago County. We further provide mutual aid with the Beloit Wisconsin police department regarding crossing the border for investigations and active incidents. I responded to the area looking for the suspect and slowly drove past Macktown Lounge eastbound on Prairie Hill Road. I observed a maroon SUV leaving the back of Macktown Lounge whose driver matched the description of the suspect. When I saw him it appeared he tried to cover his face and place the hood from his sweatshirt over his head. Based upon the report of the subject fleeing on foot initially, it was most likely that he had carjacked this vehicle and therefore there was a possibility that the owner had now been harmed or endangered. I attempted to execute a traffic stop and the suspect immediately fled from me at high speed westbound on Prairie Hill Road. I suspected based upon the prior 10-78 call for shots fired that available units from neighboring jurisdictions may have already responded close to the scene and the subject was outside of where a perimeter could be established. The suspect sped through multiple intersections, a crossing for a bike path, travelled into oncoming traffic, and disregarded multiple stop signs and red lights at high speed. The suspect drove through residential and business areas at high speeds and lost control at one point in a residential area. I believed the driver would cause great injury to another motorist or pedestrian if the pursuit did not end soon. I continued to pursue as I felt he posed a continued risk to the community if he escaped and would likely engage in similar reckless escape attempts and violence to resist arrest if located later after escaping.  At all times throughout this pursuit I believed he was likely to be in possession of a firearm.","IL"
"785","Bellwood Police Department","01/13/2023",NA,52,"Male","Black","Unknown","Near the conclusion of the pursuit, the suspect went head on toward a Beloit PD squad car before maneuvering in another direction. I was not able to determine if the suspect made contact with the Beloit officerâ€™s squad as Ofc Sarver was now the lead car in the pursuit. Ofc Sarver became the lead squad car in the pursuit near Shirland Avenue and Eighth Street. After going head on with the Beloit squad, Ofc Sarver made contact with the suspectâ€™s vehicle as if he was making a pit maneuver while the suspect made a left turn at high speed. At this time the suspect vehicle was turned and slowed. I suspected the suspect may have been largely boxed in at the time and would abandon the vehicle and either fight or flee on foot. I stopped and was preparing to exit my vehicle and pursue.  The suspect looked at me and appeared to come at me intentionally. The suspect accelerated while appearing to turn the direction of his vehicle in an attempt to make a direct impact with the driverâ€™s door of my squad car. I donâ€™t recall if I ever partially exited the vehicle but recall the feeling of fleeing back into the vehicle to maintain cover in the squad car to keep from being crushed. I braced for contact as the vehicle struck my driverâ€™s door with force and pinned my door shut. I feared I was trapped as well as exposed to potential gunfire as I was still operating under the assumption that he was armed and threatened to fire or fired shots at other officers. I was further concerned for the safety of other innocent bystanders should he resume flight at a high rate of speed, and for the immediate threat to other officers on scene that may have exited their squad cars by this time and would be at substantial risk should he attempt to reverse or accelerate away.","IL"
