Add William Pye execution - 2024 Georgia -- but not if executions from PDF can be webscraped? - ask Amy
-> GA otherwise done
- Start with 2000

Hawaii 
- all of 2020 up to date -- just names
- up to Ernest Romero (DO ERNEST ROMERO) in 2021

Data explorer should mouse over specific areas and then load new link to web scrape new link uploaded (?) 
	- write down which name has which information
	- maintain that dataset and when there is variation between what WAS available and what IS available -> capture new information and merge

Montana:  
	- use headless browser (needs to understand javascript)
	- load page and wait for javascript to run in the background (set wait time for 5/10 seconds)
	- post-process data, including:
		- create mini dataset matching facility acronyms to 
full names 
	- if can find tableau worksheet name, add .csv to the end to get data easily extracted 

ADD SYSTEM TO EACH INDIVIDUAL DATASET BEFORE SENDING TO MIKE
	- have consistent missing variable
	- convert each date to xx/xx/xxxx even if missing information...else, missing
	- fill in press release date with date information was webscraped 
		not perfect, but better than nothing
	-
